	<div id="tab-3-content"><h2 class="tab">Group Project</h2>
	<h2>Group Project</h2>
<p>The aim of this substantial group project is to immerse the students in a life-like scenario of a company developing digital systems. The project will involve the design, construction and implementation of a complete FPGA-based digital system, providing students with practical experience of project management and team skills. The system will include both software (such as human-computer interface, low-level programming) and hardware (such as FPGA, A/D converters, communication interfaces) components. The project will culminate in the design and realisation of a printed circuit board hosting a FPGA interfaced to a variety of peripherals. Communication links allowing connection to a PC will enable the creation of a diverse range of multimedia, diagnostic or communication systems. Furthermore, at the end of the project, students will keep the boards they have designed, providing them with a complete FPGA development system, allowing them to further investigate digital systems design.</p>
<p>The project preparation will begin towards the end of the Autumn term when groups will be given a Quality Assurance manual, that will prepare the students to establish effective company policies, procedures and roles for group members, introducing the Quality Assurance processes applied to medium to large projects in industry.</p>
<p><span class="right"><img src="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronics/postgraduate/duke_94x100.png" alt=""  title="" width="94" height="100"  /></span>&zwnj;</p>
<p>In the Autumn term, a module on 'C Programming' will hone the students' skills required to effectively carry out the software components of the project. The module will provide a practical introduction to writing and running C programs as an example of a procedural programming language.</p>
<p>In the Spring term, the actual project will get under way. Groups of 4-6 students will be formed, assigned a target system to design, and provided with a budget. In this term, the students will prepare an implementation plan that will be followed for the remainder of the project. Detailed system specifications will be established and the budget allocated, taking into account the cost of components and off-the-shelf IP modules.</p>
<p><span class="left"><img src="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronics/postgraduate/pcb_125x125.png" alt=""  title="" width="125" height="125"  /></span>&zwnj;</p>
<p>In the Summer term, the project will continue with the pre-implementation phase. Students will design a PCB with the components (FPGA, communication interfaces, displays, memories, etc.) defined in the system specifications. The design will be sent to fabrication and returned by the end of term. Along with the PCB design, the students will develop a block-level algorithmic description of the system to be implemented, defining the role of each component within the system and beginning the development of the software components of the system.</p>
<p>System implementation will begin in July, after the end of the last exam session. The PCB will be tested by verifying the operation of the single components. The software interface on the host PC will be finalised and the board-to-PC communication instantiated. The core of the system, i.e., the implementation of the algorithm in the FPGA circuit, will be designed, simulated, realised, and verified. The simulation and debugging techniques acquired in the taught modules will be employed to ensure the correct operation of the system. The outcome of this final part of the project will be the actual realisation of the system implemented on the custom-designed PCB.</p>
<h2>An Example Group Project: An OGG-Vorbis Audio Player</h2>
<p><span class="right"><img src="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronics/postgraduate/vorbisdotcom.png" alt=""  title="" width="251" height="76"  /></span>&zwnj;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Spring term, a group of five student is formed and assigned the task of designing an OGG-Vorbis audio decoder/player. The group meets regularly and establishes an implementation plan, assigning tasks to each member and fixing deadlines for the development of the system. In accordance to the requirements of the project the budget is assigned.</p>
<p>At some point in the term, a group leader is selected by the group, responsible for the overall supervision of the group and tasked with ensuring that all tasks are progressing according to the plan, that all documents are prepared on time, and that any emergencies are handled.</p>
<p>Based on the individual skills and interests, the following assignments are made: students 1 and 2 will develop the algorithm and the FPGA implementation, student 3 will handle the peripherals (memories, SD cards, A/D converters), student 4 will be in charge of the board-to-PC communication, and student 5 will design the software interface of the system.</p>
<p><span class="left"><img src="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronics/postgraduate/circuit_100x150.jpg" alt="Circuit board"  title="Circuit board" width="100" height="150"  /></span>&zwnj;</p>
<p>The overall specifications of the system are defined: the PC interface will allow the user to select the audio tracks to be played and parameters such as volume, play mode, etc. The selected tracks will be downloaded to the board through a USB interface (the wireless solution is discarded because of budget considerations) and stored in a SD card. Once the tracks are stored, the board will be disconnected from the PC and operate as a stand-alone unit. The FPGA will retrieve the current track from the SD card and store it in a RAM chip for faster access. The data will be decoded and sent to a D/A converter connected to a set of speakers. A black-and-white display (colour displays being too expensive) will show the title of the track and the elapsed time. Part of the budget is used to acquire a MicroBlaze IP to simplify the implementation of the OGG decoder algorithm in the FPGA.</p>
<p>In the Summer term, students 3 and 4 work together on the design of the PCB, placing and connecting all the components. Once it is ready, the board is sent to fabrication (one board per student will be produced) and the students work on preparing a set of test strategies to verify the correct operation of the board and prepare a document describing their work. Meanwhile, student 5 starts looking at the human-computer interface and to define the software architecture of the system. Students 1 and 2 study the OGG-Vorbis algorithm and start drawing up a detailed system architecture to realise a system capable of meeting the performance requirements of playback.</p>
<p>In July, the boards are ready. Student 3 tests and verifies the operation of the peripheral components, using the pre-defined test strategies. Student 4 tests the communication interface to allow the PC to communicate with the board using the USB interface, working with student 5 on the low-level software drivers. Students 1 and 2 divide their task: student 1 implements the hardware IP and the custom logic required for the decoding, while student 2 will work on the low-level assembler code for the MicroBlaze.</p>
<p>At this stage, a crisis occurs: the custom logic is proving to be more complex than estimated and student 1 cannot meet the implementation deadline. The group leader identifies that the interface design is actually ahead of schedule and reassigns student 5 to help with the hardware. With his help, the deadline is met.</p>
<p>Once all the separate parts of the project have been developed and tested, the various components are merged: the software interface is connected through the low-level drivers and the USB connection to the FPGA, which accesses the SD cards and the RAM, decodes the tracks, and sends the output to the D/A converters and the speakers. At first, nothing works, but with time the errors are debugged, except for one: the FPGA design has timing problems and is not able to simultaneously decode, output, move data from the SD card to the RAM, move data from the RAM to the MicroBlaze, and update the play time on the display every second.</p>
<p><span class="right"><img src="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/electronics/postgraduate/microBlaze_200x40.png" alt=""  title="" width="200" height="40"  /></span>&zwnj;</p>
<p>Two solutions are possible: redesign the decode logic and the MicroBlaze program or reduce the functionality of the system. The first solution has to be discarded because of the little time left, so the second option is selected. As it turns out, removing the play time display routine is sufficient to allow the system to work. This is quickly done and the final system is described in the report, including the causes of the problem and the motivations for the choice. The system does not quite meet the specifications, but the loss of functionality is minimal and the effect on the final score is insignificant.</p>
<p>The demonstration and the presentation go seamlessly and the students are awarded their degree, with the additional satisfaction of going home with their very own OGG-Vorbis Audio player!</p></div>
