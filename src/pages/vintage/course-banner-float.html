<h3>What subjects should I have studied before?</h3>
<p>Applied Social Science draws upon many disciplines, if you have previously studied sociology, politics, history, geography or psychology, you may be interested in this degree programme. Similarly, some of our students choose one of our Applied Social Science programmes because it is a subject they have not studied before, yet appeals to their interests.</p>
<h3>A taster of the subject</h3>
<p>As part of our optional workshops available in the Summer Term, some of our students have created videos designed to provide an overview of the subject. You can watch their interviews with Professor Jonathan Bradshaw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/chwellbeing" target="_blank" title="Child Well-being Social Media Project [New window]">online via YouTube</a>.</p>

<h3>Placement</h3>
<p>During the summer vacation before the start of your third year, or during the Autumn Term, you will undertake a work-shadowing placement lasting for around 80 hours.</p>
<p>This is assessed through a placement report. In this you will be able to trace how national or international policy on children and young people gets translated into particular programmes at a local level. Through watching professional workers at work this offers a completely different form of learning experience which some students go on to develop within their dissertation or follow through in the development of their own career.<br /><br />Recent examples of placements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in a Sure Start Children&rsquo;s Centre</li>
<li>Local Authority Key Worker support with vulnerable teenagers</li>
<li>Special educational needs units in mainstream schools</li>
<li>Work with Young Offending Teams</li>
<li>A residential home in Uganda</li>
<li>Work in A Pupil Referral Unit</li>
<li>Shadowing key worker support witj a Sexual Exploitation Programme</li>
</ul>
<h4>Important note about placements</h4>
<p>To undertake a placement, you may be required to undergo a&nbsp;Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. Having a criminal conviction is not an automatic bar to entry but failure to disclose relevant information may result subsequently in termination of the placement. Should you declare a criminal conviction, it may be necessary to consult our partnership agencies in relation to placements.</p>
<h3>Dissertation examples</h3>
<p>The third year dissertation is a great opportunity to apply your knowledge and understanding in independent supervised research on a topic of your interest. Previous dissertation titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approaches to &lsquo;inclusion&rsquo; of children with special educational needs: a contrast between mainstream and special schools</li>
<li>A qualitative study of teenage pregnancy and parenthood</li>
<li>Media Images of &lsquo;youth&rsquo; and young people&rsquo;s responses to these</li>
<li>Parents perceptions of &lsquo;Positive Parenting&rsquo; techniques</li>
<li>Combining work and childcare: factors affecting parents decisions and choices</li>
<li>Child health issues in debt reduction programmes in Uganda and Tanzania</li>
<li>A qualitative study of professional perceptions of child sexual exploitation</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="nothingbeside">Academic integrity module</h2>
<p>In addition to the above you will also need to complete our online Academic Integrity module. This covers some of the essential skills and knowledge which will help you to study independently and produce work of a high academic standard which is vital for success at York.</p>

<p>This module will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>define academic integrity and academic misconduct;</li>
<li>explain why and when you should reference source material and other people's work;</li>
<li>provide interactive exercises to help you to assess whether you've understood the concepts;</li>
<li>provide answers to FAQs and links to useful resources.</li>
</ul>
</div><!--end content tab--> <div id="course-teaching-content">
<h2>How you'll be taught</h2>
<h3>Teaching approaches</h3>
<p>The teaching methods used in each module are tailored to help you achieve its learning outcomes, but typically feature a mixture of formal lectures and more interactive elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/spsw/undergraduate/why-study-social-policy-or-social-work/teaching/">Watch our videos showcasing a sample of our modules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We place great emphasis on <strong>small group working</strong> and encourage students to interact with staff both inside and outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Whilst your first year lectures will be in larger groups - typically 50 to 100 students - they are supplemented by small group seminars of around 10-15 students.&nbsp;You will be expected to research topics in advance of seminars and often asked to make presentations to the seminar group.</p>
<p>In years 2 and 3, <strong>lecture groups are smaller</strong> as you will begin to specialise more deeply and so follow varied routes of study. In year 2 lectures will typically be around 30 students and in year 3 a typical lecture group is around 15 students, but in both years groups of under 10 may exist on some modules.</p>
<p>Aside from lectures and discussion based seminars, many modules in years 2 and 3 make use of <strong>group based workshops</strong>, some make use of scenario based role plays and some involve practical sessions where you analyse data in order to understand a specific issue in more depth.</p>
<p>Some year 2 and 3 modules also make use of<strong> outside speakers</strong> from policy related organisations: these speakers help to bring cutting-edge knowledge of the latest issues in policy and practice into the classroom.</p>
<p>All modules make use of the virtual learning environment, an <strong>online space for resources and activities</strong> associated with the module. Some modules will involve tutor driven interactive tasks that students must complete between classroom based sessions, others may simply provide access to resources allowing you to recap lecture slides or undertake further reading.</p>
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>Modules vary in length, credit weighting and the way in which they are assessed.</p>
<p>First and second year modules last for the full academic year (three terms), count for 30 credits, usually with some form of assessment part way through the year and a final assessment task in the third term.</p>
<p>Third year option modules are taught in a single term, counting for 20 credits, and are usually assessed by a single piece of work handed in at the start of the term after teaching has finished for the module.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>All students are allocated a <strong>personal supervisor</strong> responsible for supporting you throughout your three years. One-to-one meetings between you and your supervisor are scheduled twice a term.</p>
<p>All members of staff also have <strong>weekly office hours</strong> during term time that allow any student to make any appointment to discuss issues related to their classes in one-to-one sessions in staff offices.</p>
<p>In the third year every student is allocated an individual member of academic staff as a <strong>dissertation supervisor</strong>: they will provide one-to-one support on your final year research project (dissertation) throughout the year.</p>
<p>In addition, through the combination of relatively small group sizes and structured opportunities to interact with staff outside of the classroom, we aim to create a supportive environment where staff and students work closely together both inside and outside of timetabled sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div><!--end teaching tab-->
 <div id="course-assessment-content">
<h2>How you'll be assessed</h2>
<p>Learning is assessed through a wide range of methods, with a strong emphasis on continuous assessment.</p>
<p>The most common form of assessment is through essays, typically around 3,500 words in length. You will be supported in your first year with seminar sessions on writing an academic essay, the style of which will be different from your previous education. Throughout the degree, module leaders will often provide opportunities for additional support, such as workshops, revision sessions or preparation activities. In addition, if you wish for further explanation then you can book an appointment as part of our staff office hours arrangement.</p>
<p>The end of degree dissertation research project is 10,000 words in length. You will be supported with a dissertation supervisor as you specialise on a particular area of the subject you are interested in.</p>
<p>Other assessment methods that might be encountered include presentations, group workshop reports, applied policy reports, data analysis exercises and portfolios of work gathered through the duration of a module. There is only minimal use of closed examinations across the programme as a whole.</p>
</div><!--end assessment tab-->
 <div id="course-careers-content">
<h2>Careers and employability</h2>
<p>All our degree programmes offer a foundation in the social sciences and a range of specialist modules which develop knowledge of social problems, their social, cultural, political, economic and global contexts, and of interventions that address them. This forms a knowledge base which will equip you to think critically and contribute creatively in a wide range of employment contexts, in the public, private and third sector.</p>
<p>We offer opportunities to develop skills in working independently and in groups, information searching and communication (including evidence-based writing and oral presentations), problem-solving, awareness of inequality and diversity, research (quantitative and qualitative), IT and use of social media. These transferable skills are highly valued by employers and the University Careers Service can offer you guidance on how you can best showcase these skills in interviews.</p>
<p>You will be able to pursue career-related interests, whether related to particular issues or groups (e.g. through following the Children and Young People or Crime and Criminal Justice pathways, or taking specialist modules available to all e.g. on Sustainable Development and Social Inclusion, Environmental Policy, Housing Policy), particular organisational contexts (e.g. a module on Social Enterprise is particularly useful to those interested in working in or setting up a social enterprise), or particular roles (e.g. modules on the Policy Process and Policy Analysis are of particular interest to those interested in policy work).</p>
<p>In addition, our work-based placement (a core part of our Children and Young People or Crime and Criminal Justice pathways and an option to the other programmes) increases understanding of the relationship between policy, implementation and practice in specific contexts, and also develops, and offers useful opportunities to demonstrate to future employers a range of employability skills.</p>
<h3>Example career paths</h3>
<p>Recent examples of employment destinations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate trainee with a national children's charity</li>
<li>Work for a local authority e.g. commissioning children's services, project officer, planning officer</li>
<li>Child protection coordinator</li>
<li>Children's outreach family work</li>
<li>Applications officer to a fund for families with disabled and seriously ill children</li>
<li>Resource worker to a multi-agency partnership</li>
<li>Curriculum enrichment coordinator for a college</li>
<li>Housing management trainee with a housing association</li>
</ul>
<p>Other students have gone on to develop their skills through</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgraduate training e.g. in social work, teaching, occupational therapy</li>
<li>Postgraduate research on children and young people</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employability</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/study/careers-skills/" target="_blank">University Careers support</a> which provides guidance and opportunities for making you more employable, your personal supervisor will support you in creating an employabilty plan to help you focus on what skills you possess or wish to develop.</p>
<h3>Extra-curricular</h3>
<p>The Department also offers an optional series of workshops at the end of the Summer Term where students may undertake a group multimedia project, utilising social media to promote awareness of a social policy issue or campaign. This offers a fresh set of creative and communication skills relevant to a number of socially-orientated organisations.</p>

<p>Help and advice about the application process may be directed to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/study/" target="_blank" title="Study at York">Student Recruitment and Admissions</a>.</p>
<h3>Once you have submitted an application</h3>
<p>Our Admissions Tutor will look at your application and pay particular attention to your personal statement.&nbsp;In personal statements we are looking for students who&nbsp;have an academic interest in society, perhaps life experiences that&nbsp;are relevant to the degree courses e.g. family circumstances or&nbsp;employment, and have made a contribution to society through, for&nbsp;example, school clubs and volunteering.</p>
<p>For our Applied Social Science and Social Policy programmes (L430, L431, L432, L433) you will NOT be expected to attend an interview. Once accepted, we do invite you to attend a visit day in Spring to give you the opportunity to learn a little more about the subject, our Department and the University. Offer holders will be able to sign up to the visit day through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/you-at-york/" target="_blank" title="You@York">You@York</a>, our dedicated site for accepted applicants to the University.</p>

<h3>Mature students</h3><p>We welcome applications from mature students and we have a firm commitment to supporting your progression through all our courses. Many mature students have studied successfully in the Department (see our student profiles).&nbsp;An interest in Applied Social Science and Social Policy often arises through life experience, which enriches the course for all students.</p>
<p>We will consider applications individually, and if you do not hold standard entry requirements we have our Extended Degree route with a foundation year leading to study on our Social Policy or Applied Social Science programmes.</p>
<p>Get in touch with us and we'll be happy to discuss your options: <a href="mailto:spsw-admissions@york.ac.uk">spsw-admissions@york.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;or apply straight away through UCAS.</p>
