<li>The Philosophical Theology of the XVIII C. Reverend Charles Chauncy of Boston</li>
<li>To give an account on the philosophical dimension in the theology of the Reverend Charles Chauncy, particularly with regard to his notion of the nature of <em>Justification</em>&nbsp;&ndash;its causes, evidences of it, etc.; but also his notion of the role played by divine grace in it (both operative and co-operative grace) and of the concept of conversion as a transformative experience in the spiritual growth of the individual.</li>

<li>&ldquo;<em>Missing Pieces: Locating Berkeley&rsquo;s Apparently Abandoned Parts of the</em> Principles&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Missing Pieces</em> investigates George Berkeley&rsquo;s design to refute sceptical and atheistic thinkers during his time by questioning the dogmatic assumption Berkeley abandoned his intended scheme. In 1710, the <em>Principles</em> was first published as &lsquo;Part 1.&rsquo; However, the intended Part 2 and possible Part 3 never appeared and the descriptor &lsquo;Part 1&rsquo; was removed from later editions of the <em>Principles</em>. To date, no systematic examination has considered this program in its own right or its importance to Berkeley&rsquo;s system as a whole. Drawing on explicit, implicit, and reasonably inferred objectives of this plan, the study probes Berkeley&rsquo;s corpus for its execution and completion. The outcomes will either support the traditional assertion of abandonment or provide evidence for the fulfilment of the project, and they will bear significance on the continuity of Berkeley&rsquo;s thought and his relation and influence on other Early Modern philosophers.</li>

<li><em>A Faith Without Foundation</em></li>
<li>I'm interested in how we can start from a broadly anti-foundationalist, anti-realist, non-absolutist position (such as, for instance, that espoused by Rorty) yet at the same time hold religious beliefs. My research has led me to explore the philosophical work of Cornel West, who professes both a form of neopragmatism articulated in the terms we have just laid out and re-packaged as <em>historicism</em>, and a strong Christian faith. But West's historicism leads him into epistemic relativism, from where it appears very difficult to make any satisfactory claims about God at all, let alone one's relationship with him. My job is to follow him down the rabbit hole without getting lost, and come out of the other side with a coherent understanding of what such a faith, as well as the moral and epistemic claims that go alongside it, might look like.</li>

<li><em>Impossible Fictions</em></li>
<li>Stories frequently depict impossible circumstances. In fictions from <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy </em>to <em>The Shining</em>, a range of different impossibilities are used. Previous research on this topic has looked at the metaphysics and logic of these depictions, but I propose an aesthetic evaluation of these fictions, understanding them first and foremost as artistic endeavours. My work explores the aesthetic effects of these impossibilities, as well as their influence on the way we imagine and interpret fictions.</li>

<li><em>Perception as the source of all knowledge: intrinsic properties and mind-independence</em></li>
<li>I argue that perceptual experience is what explains our acquisition of our basic concepts, such as our concepts of spatial properties. It does this by providing the subject with knowledge of what those properties are like. Perceptual experience has two distinct dimensions - a subjective dimension and an objective dimension. I argue that both dimensions of perceptual experience are necessary components of its aforementioned epistemic function. I argue that only when perception is thought of on the Naive realist model can we see how the objective and subjective dimensions of perceptual &nbsp;experience can co-exist without interfering with one another. Moreover, this duality of dimensions may also provide the subject with one basis for the conceptual distinction between subject (i.e. herself) and object.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Moral Arguments and The Frege-Geach problem</em></li>
<li>My research interest is the nature of moral discourse, whether it has a cognitive or non-cognitive nature. In particular, I am asking whether the Frege-Geach problem constitutes a good reason to reject the non-cognitivist view on moral discourse, and also whether a non-cognitivist view on moral discourse can give a plausible account of logical concepts such as validity and inconsistency, which, contrary to the standard account, cannot appeal to the notions of truth and falsity.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>Robert Davies</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Self-Knowledge, Memory, and Deliberation</em></li>
<li>Self-knowledge has purportedly distinctive features and explaining them is what a theory of self-knowledge is meant to do. It is sometimes thought that a special faculty (e.g. introspection or a &lsquo;brain scanning&rsquo; mechanism) is required to explain these features. I argue for an economical theory of self-knowledge&mdash;a theory that explains the distinctive features of self-knowledge without recourse to capacities not employed in other domains of Knowledge. I show how the epistemology of memory is crucial in some approaches to explaining self-knowledge and suggest there is a surprising convergence of the purportedly distinctive features of self-knowledge and the features we might expect to be exhibited by a correctly functioning memory. If some distinctive features of self-knowledge can be explained by reference to memory, then further investigation into the explanatory uses of memory for philosophical issues surrounding self-knowledge may prove fruitful. I assess the extent and limitations of this role by considering how a theory of self-knowledge, with memory explaining some key distinctive features, might fare against common desiderata for theories of self-knowledge.</li>

<li><em>Cinematic Humanism: Realism not empiricism</em></li>
<li>Cinematic Humanism is the philosophical understanding of the fact that fictional films provide valuable insights into what it is to be human. It provides a unique appreciation of the relationship between the cognitive, the aesthetic and the cinematic. Prompted by this century&rsquo;s latest developments in the philosophy of art and literature, particularly arguments for a so-called new &lsquo;Literary Humanism&rsquo;, Cinematic Humanism is the first-ever extension of this principled approach into the area of film, rooting its philosophical authority in the philosophy of language,aesthetics, &nbsp;epistemology and the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein.</li>

<h2>Gordon Haynes&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">(MPhil)</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Trenton Merricks senses that we think of ourselves as souls that inhabit bodies and at death our souls go off to start another wonderful life, in another place. Christian theology teaches that this other life is reached only with the very same body that once walked the earth. There must then be a switch. On our deathbeds, God must switch us, leaving behind a representation of us to be buried and whisking the real us away &ndash; what is left to mourn over is some sort of simulacra. Or we can think of ourselves in a cartoon lift where, just like Tom &amp; Jerry we jump out just before the final impact, walking away into the sunset unharmed. These solutions would get us round the problems of the theologians who spent hours pondering how we could be &lsquo;reassembled&rsquo; once our bodies have decomposed and the molecules used in other living things. But aren&rsquo;t we more than a just fusion of body and soul? How can we account for the Christian resurrection of the body in a way that is more satisfactory and less dependent on these bizarre thought experiments? Contemporary philosophical speculation on the resurrection using ancient metaphysical concepts may help us to find alternative routes to justify our belief about who we really are and how we can be resurrected.</li>

<li><em>Topic: Dialogical Empiricism: The Burden of Proof upon Philosophical Methods</em></li>
<li>Area: Philosophical Methodology</li>
<li>My research is concerned with how academic philosophical dialogue should be conducted. More specifically, I am interested in the following situation. Imagine that you are discussing a philosophical issue with another philosopher. You assert some particular proposition P, and your interlocutor questions whether P is actually true, though without herself offering any grounds in favour of P. How should you respond? Do you always have to support (or else retract) P when challenged, or are there certain conditions under which P is privileged and has to be accepted by default, e.g. when P is foundational? Drawing on Informal Logic, I establish empirically that defeating one&rsquo;s opponent in argument is the prevalent goal of philosophical dialogue (though not necessarily of philosophical thought), hence it is prudent to not claim that P is privileged. Absent such privilege, how can you support P? By examining certain pragmatic requirements to be met by any evidential support for P, I show that such supporting relations should prudently not cross any inference barriers.&nbsp;As I explain, this renders it instrumentally irrational to continue many of the common employments of <em>a priori</em> evidence in academic philosophical dialogue. The implications of this methodological restriction for substantive philosophical debates are broadly quietist, since many such debates depend upon the evidential employment of various kinds of a priori evidence and thus cannot be conducted any longer (with notable exceptions mainly in the Philosophy of Science). You can find my CV <a href="https://york.academia.edu/ConnyRhode">here</a>.</li>

<li>My research, which is a philosophical examination of love for learning seeks solutions for young people&rsquo;s disengagement with learning. Young people who &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t withdrawn from schools but are not fully taking part either because they have given up any trying or because they resist to do so&rdquo; (Lumby, 2013) is estimated at between one fifth and one third of all 14-16 year olds (Steedman &amp; Stoney, 2004). This is extremely worrying.Much of the new curricula for education cite the love for learning as the linchpin for continual personal and professional development. In spite of this, there has been very little research into what &lsquo;love&rsquo; in love for learning refers to, and why exactly it should be seen as something worth pursuing. Without a clear understanding of what exactly this love entails, how can we do any real work to foster or encourage it? &nbsp;In line with this, my research focuses on why love for learning is a valuable thing and how, if it is at all possible, does one begin to 'love learning'? For example, is this something that can be taught or acquired, or something that is innately possessed but needs to be recognised or 'triggered', or a combination? &nbsp;Based on my findings, I also hope to present a basic &lsquo;toolkit&rsquo; that could assist educators and policy makers in encouraging this love for learning.</li>

<li><em>What are musical works, and how might we analyse the creative processes of their composition and performance?</em></li>
<li>I will be researching the ontology of musical works, and the implications which answers to ontological questions about music have for our understanding of the creative processes of composition and performance, and our definitions of creativity. Some of the ontological questions I will be focusing on are: what types of entities are musical works? Are musical works created or discovered? What are the criteria for the numerical and qualitative identity of musical works and their performances? And where do musical works exist in time? I hope to establish a Complex Platonist view of musical works, following the work of Jerrold Levinson (1980), who views musical works as abstract types which are instantiated by performances. The Complex Platonist also considers musical works to be partially discovered and partially created, which I believe will have important implications for how we view composition and performance, and for our definitions of creativity. For example, if musical works were entirely discovered, it would seem that the composer would not be bringing the work into existence. On the other hand, if musical works are created, the composer plays a more active role. I will also discuss performance: how a musician interacts with a musical work, and how the interpretation or editing of a musical work might affect its identity.&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>The Epistemological Significance of Irrelevant Causal Factors</em></li>
<li>How should we respond to the fact that our confidence in many of our beliefs can be explained by facts about our upbringing and background? It seems, for instance, that our religious beliefs are often held as a result of our upbringing. Although we often have reasons to offer in defence of our religious beliefs, it seems as if these reasons might also be explained by similar facts about our upbringing and background. The problem is, oftentimes these facts have no bearing on whether the beliefs which they explain are true or false. In this sense, they are irrelevant. This seems to be problematic. I hope to find a way to more systematically account for, and respond to, this apparent problem of the irrelevant causes. I will draw on psychological and sociological findings as well as the growing body of work in social epistemology.</li>

<li><em>Disorders of Consciousness: rationalism, hallucination and psychosis</em></li>
<li>My research focuses on the visual and auditory hallucinations which occur to people during severe mental illness and examines whether experience has an explanatory role in our understanding of these disorders or whether a different sort of explanation is required. My aim is to argue against the role of experience and in favour of a rationalist account. According to rationalism, the hallucinations in question are fully explainable in terms of an anomalous or irrational belief formation process. In other words, it is my view that the visual and auditory hallucinations had by a person during episodes of psychosis are explainable in terms of the person&rsquo;s clinically deluded beliefs alone.</li>

<h2>David Worsley</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Making Amends: Atonement and the Second-Person</em></li>
<li>If atonement between victim and malefactor is made, both persons are in some sense united with each other. Borrowing from medieval philosophy and contemporary cognitive science, I examine what this eventual union might look like, and what atonement must do to make such union possible. I argue that any attempt to explain how atonement can be made must adequately deal with the appropriateness of guilt and shame in the wrongdoer, as well as promoting the wrongdoer's desire for union with their victim. I argue that the presence of guilt (the 'deontic' problem), shame (the 'relational' problem), or a lack of desire for union (the 'ontological' problem) in the wrongdoer can each prevent union between a wrongdoer and their victim, and that each of these must be dealt with separately. Developing an account of wrongdoing that uses what Stephen Darwall describes as the 'second-person standpoint', I offer a solution to each of these problems. Shame can be defeated by offering a sincere apology (where sincerity is grounded on repentance, and, where necessary, some supererogatory penance), the lack of desire can be dealt with by a certain kind of second-personal encounter with the victim, and guilt can be overcome through the payment of some reparation. However, union between victim and wrongdoer also requires the <em>victim</em> to desire union with the wrongdoer. I deny that the victim owes the wrongdoer the opportunity for what Aquinas describes as 'real union', nevertheless I argue that the victim does indeed owe their wrongdoer the opportunity for what Aquinas calls 'affective union.' I conclude with the thought that although atonement cannot be coerced, it can and indeed should be facilitated and encouraged by others.&nbsp;</li>
