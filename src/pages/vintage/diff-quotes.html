	<div id="tab-5-content"><h2 class="tab">How to apply</h2>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Applications are currently being invited for study to start in <strong>May 2016</strong>. &nbsp;The closing date for applications is <strong>29th January 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If places remain after the closing date we will open a later application window but we would recommend early application in order to secure a place.</p>
<p>When completing the application form you will need to write a Personal Statement, answering all the questions on this template and acknowledging the Requirements of Study.</p>
<p><a title="York Online Masters in Public Management: Personal Statement (opens in a new window)" target="_blank" href="http://www.york.ac.uk/media/spsw/documents/prospective-students/Personal Statement.doc" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('http://www.york.ac.uk/media/spsw/documents/prospective-students/Personal Statement.doc'); ">Online MA Personal Statement (MS Word <img class="icon" src="http://www.york.ac.uk/media/global/icons/icon_doc.gif" alt=" " width="16" height="16" />, 26kb)</a></p>
<p>We aim to send application decisions within 1 month.</p>
<p class="cta"><a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/apply?course=DPMMPASINT1" target="_blank">Click here to apply</a></p>
<h2>Guidance notes</h2>
<p>If you are organised with your paperwork and have already written a Personal Statement the application form should take about 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Please note: you can save your application at any time and come back to it at a later date, or simply submit it as soon as it is complete. &nbsp;Once you have submitted your form you can send any additional paperwork to <a href="mailto:spsw-online@york.ac.uk">spsw-online@york.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your form is submitted you will receive an automated email from the university and then it will be forwarded to the department. &nbsp;Once the form arrives in the department you will receive an email which will detail any additional documents which we might need before your application is forwarded to the Admissions Committee. &nbsp;We may ask for a short piece of written work, or perhaps to arrange a Skype interview. &nbsp;Subject to the prompt receipt of references and any additional documentation we aim to let all applicants know the outcome of their application within 1 month.</p>
<h2>Application process advice</h2>
<p>When registering for an applicant account please make a note of your username and password so that you will be able to login again later. &nbsp;If your application is accepted you will need to access this site to accept your offer.</p>
<p>Please complete all home address details in full. &nbsp;If you would like to use an alternative address for your course material parcel please use the Contact Address section. &nbsp;Wherever possible use a physical address rather than a post office box - couriers find it difficult to deliver to post office boxes.</p>
<p>Please give as much detail as possible about your employment history on the application form. &nbsp;A CV is not required unless you feel it gives additional information.</p>
<p>Referees should ideally be from your professional rather than academic life. &nbsp;The Admissions Committee are looking to see how the programme fits with your career objectives. &nbsp;You must provide the email address for each of your referees. &nbsp;When you submit your application form your referees will then receive an automated email with all the instructions they need to write and submit their letter - it would be a good idea if you told them when to look out for this email as occasionally they can be diverted to Spam folders. &nbsp;Please ask them to send their letters promptly.</p>
<p>If you do not come from a majority English speaking country (as defined by the UK Home Office) you will be required to undertake an English language proficiency test (as detailed on the Entry Requirements page). &nbsp;If you use English on a day to day basis within your workplace please ask your referee to detail this as part of their reference letter and we may be able to waive the requirement for a test.</p>
<p>If you have any queries about the application process please email <a href="mailto:spsw-online@york.ac.uk">spsw-online@york.ac.uk</a> and we will be happy to assist.</p>

<h2>Online learning - how does it work?</h2>
<p>Our approach to e-learning is distinctive and may be different from your general perceptions about this mode of study.</p>
<h3>Key points</h3>
<p>The key points about our approach are:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p>I like the online studies because everyone contributes in the class discussions, something that usually doesn't happen in face to face classes because you will always have people who dominate discussions and others are quiet so from that perspective online study is great for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>These are not self study programmes which leave you on your own. &nbsp;You will be part of an active learning community with regular contacts and activities.</li>
<li>While the e-based approach means that our programmes are very&nbsp;<strong>flexible</strong>&nbsp;- you can study at any time or location - they also involve a&nbsp;<strong>structured</strong>&nbsp;approach to learning. &nbsp;You wil be asked to take part in some activities each week.</li>
<li>A key part of this weekly study pattern is the regular&nbsp;<strong>discussion topic.</strong>&nbsp; You can join in with this discussion at any time during the week to suit you: you never have to be online at the same time as other people. &nbsp;You will join the discussion by posting your comments in a forum. &nbsp;The forums are very simple to use. &nbsp;They provide a reflective and supportive environment, providing all the benefits of studying as part of a community but without having to be in a physical classroom.</li>
<li>As well as interacting with fellow students you will also have regular and structured contact with a&nbsp;<strong>dedicated and friendly academic and administrative team&nbsp;</strong>at York.</li>
<li>The programme is situated within a&nbsp;<strong>Virtual Learning Environment</strong>. &nbsp;This is a very user-friendly integrated website that provides access to study resources, discussion forums, the University of York Electronic Library and your University of York email account.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Studying a module : how it works</h3>
<p>Each module is structured into weekly units, each of which addresses a theme. &nbsp;Within each unit you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<strong>module text</strong>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Read up to three&nbsp;<strong>articles or chapters</strong>&nbsp;from books which have been chosen to support the unit (known as&nbsp;<em>'Core Readings'</em>). &nbsp;These are available online via the Virtual Learning Environment.</li>
<li>Take part in a&nbsp;<strong>discussion/activity with your tutorial group</strong>&nbsp;- a group of between 10 and 15 students whom you join with in the discussion forums. &nbsp;You join in by posting your comments on the topic, reading responses from your group and replying to them, guided by the module tutor. &nbsp;You are encouraged to join in as early and often as possible during the week in order to get the full value of the discussions. &nbsp;Participation in the activities is a requirement of studying the programme.</li>
<li>Overall, the reading that is set for each week is the eqivalent of a lecture in a traditional course, while the discussion form is the equivalent of a campus-based seminar (tutorial).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study resources</h3>
<p>The programmes have been designed to provide you with:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive, specially selected, study resources: the module text and the Core Readings.</li>
<li>Access to the University of York's Electronic Library from which you can select further material to follow up our interests and deepen understanding. &nbsp;The library holds approximately 100 electronic journals that are relevant to the themes covered in this programme, offering thousands of articles.</li>
<li>Study skills advice. &nbsp;This is provided from the central areas within the Virtual Learning Environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The York Team</h3>
<p>A key feature of this programme is the availability and quality of support that we offer - wether academic, administrative or technical. &nbsp;You will be supported by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>module tutor</strong>. &nbsp;The tutor's role is to guide you during the module. &nbsp;This includes facilitating the discussion forums, marking and providing feedback on any written exercises and offering individual support via email and Skype/telephone calls.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<strong>personal supervisor</strong>. &nbsp;Your supervisor's role is to provide ongoing academic and pastoral support during all of your time on the programme. &nbsp;Your supervisor is the person you would go to for advice about study skills technique, to review your progress in general, or to request a break in your studies. &nbsp;Your supervisor will contact you regularly but you can also contact them at any time.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<strong>dedicated support team</strong>&nbsp;who deal with any administrative or technical enquirires.</li>
</ul>
<p>All our staff, whether academic, pastoral, administrative or technical, will reply to queries within 2 working days at the latest, and usually much sooner. &nbsp;This is possible because our team is dedicated soley to the online programmes.</p></div>

<p>The flexibility of the programme is such that you can opt to leave with a Certificate if circumstances change and you are no longer able to commit to three years of study. &nbsp;If you leave but find you have more free time in the future the university welcomes returning students (subject to certain time restrictions).</p>
